* 310 Total Points
* Project Pitch (10pts)

* Project check-in 2 04/13 (100pts)
* Project check-in 3 05/11 (100pts)

## Description
The goal of the final project is to demonstrate the competencies covered in this course.  You will need to develop an application of your choosing using the Ruby on Rails framework.  In the grading criteria you will find the points you need to hit for a successful project. You are encouraged to use the book and any resources you find on line to help you build your application, but the code turned in must be your own.  Simply copying the code from the book or a tutorial directly is grounds for failure.

This projecdt may be completed in pairs.  If you are going to work on this in a pair you will need to add at least one pull request into each check-in for each person.  These pull requests will require you to look at your partners work and choose to merge it into the master branch or not.  You will also need to provide feedback for your partner on if they are meeting the course style guide or not.
