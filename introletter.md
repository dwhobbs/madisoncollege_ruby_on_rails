# Ruby on Rails Development
## Introduction Letter
Hello all of you Ruby on Rails Developers!!

I am sending you a brief letter to get you going with the Ruby on Rails Development course.  It has a lot of information that is valuable to both online learners and those who are in a traditional classroom setting.

My name is Chris Johnson and I will be your teacher for this face to face learning experience. I am a part-time Information Technology Instructor at Madison College. You can reach me via email at cgjohnson1@madisoncollege.edu. Please read through the following information which clarifies the details of the class.

##Class Structure
This will be a face to face class with a combinations of discussions, lectures, readings and labs. There will be a large amount of work as you will be learning a new language, framework and development methodology. Make sure you come to class prepared each week, doing the readings will prepare you for the lecture and in class labs.

The readings may take considerable amount of time, don't plan on just copying and pasting code but try to understand the material.  If you don't understand it bring your questions to class.


##Accessing the Class
In order to get started in this class, you need to get to the class [GitHub](https://github.com/johnsonchmatc/madisoncollege_ruby_on_rails) site.

### Necessities
* Please note that you MUST have an email address to use this course. Remember that Madison College offers all students a free email address that you can now access email from Madison Collegeâ€™s homepage.
* Access to a computer with a web browser and internet access and the ability to either run a virtual machine or a Ruby on Rails development environment.
* A Heroku.com account, which we will setup in class.
* A Bitbucket.com account, which we will setup in class.
* A Slack account (https://team-mita.slack.com/)

### Assignments
The format of the course is broken down into "weeks". The course will last for 16 weeks and each of these weeks there are various assignments. You will find the outline for the weeks of the course under the lectures section of the class [GitHub](https://github.com/johnsonchmatc/madisoncollege_ruby_on_rails) site, this content is subject to change.

### Readings & Labs
On the syllabus you will find the schedule for readings and labs. Please come to class having read the chapter and attempted the lab, we will discuss the reading and lab activities.

### Course Project
You will be working on a project during the semester, this project will be something you come up with on your own. You will need to show your progress three times during the semester, which will give you the ability to get feedback from your me and improve your project.

### Exams
There will be two 'Exams' which are oral presentations. The requirements for each of these will be distributed in class on the first day.

### Exit ticket
At the end of every class I'll have you fill out an exit ticket. The exit ticket is un-graded and my way of taking attendance along with accessing your understanding of the material from the day. You will be directed to fill out the form at [http://exitticket.johnsonch.com](http://exitticket.johnsonch.com).

### Slack
We'll use [https://team-mita.slack.com](https://team-mita.slack.com) in class as a way for you to ask questions or notify me to slowdown with out needing to raise your hand, though the old fashion hand raising still works!

### Development Environment
You will be responsible for your own development environment, we'll set this up during the first class session.  We'll use [http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/](http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/) as the guide.  I suggest either working in Linux or OS X.  If you are a Windows user I would suggest using a Linux virtual machine, however the choice is yours. You may also use a cloud environment like [https://c9.io](https://c9.io).  The first lab will require you to get a local development environment working as an exercise to understand the tools you'll be using.  However during the remainder of the semester use what works for you.

## Ways to Get Help
  * Slack: team-mita.slack.com #ruby-on-rails
  * IRC: [Tutorial](https://github.com/johnsonchmatc/madisoncollege_ruby_on_rails/blob/master/irc.md)
  * EMAIL: You can contact me via email at cgjohnson1@madisoncollege.edu and I will do my very best to get back to you within 24-48 hours. I will do my best to check my email Monday morning through Friday at 4:30pm.
  * PHONE: You can contact me via telephone at 608-301-5232. This is usually not a very efficient method as we will probably end up playing "telephone tag."

## Final Thoughts
I look forward to working and learning with you this semester. This course is always improving and adjusting, everything is subject to change.  Always look to the [GitHub](https://github.com/johnsonchmatc/madisoncollege_ruby_on_rails) site for up to date information, and if you find any errors or something doesn't make sense let me know ASAP so I can fix that.  All items in the course repository are subject to change, will try and notify you of changes and will talk about next weeks readings/labs at the end of each class lecture. It is however your responsibility to stay up to date with the course repository.

Looking forward to the semester,

-CJ
