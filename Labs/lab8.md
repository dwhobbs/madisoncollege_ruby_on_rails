#Lab 8
* Points 10

## Assignment

Create a simple link sharing site. Like a very simple Reddit.

The site should allow users to input a link and title. On the index page the links
provided by users should be clickable and open in a new browser tab/window.

### Extra credit (due before the start of next class via email with bitbucket repo)
* 10 points of extra credit by making the links be accesable via a short url (like how bitly.com works)
    * Where I can go to http://yoursite.com/asdfqm23 where 'asdfqm23' is a uniq short code and it redirects me to the link that was submitted.
* 20 points of extra credit if you create a voting system like Reddit, where users can up or down vote a link. From the index page.
* 100 points of extra credit if voting can only happen if a user is logged in and users only get one vote per link.
